Module 4 Challenge

In this project, 4 investment options are analyzed alongside the S&P 500 in an effort to decide which would be the best new addition for a retirement portfolio.

Several markers are calculated in determining the overall best investment option, including annualized returns, beta averages, and sharp ratios.
